			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<p>Below is a list of commonly asked cheese questions</p>
		</aside>
		
			<div class="mobile">
			
			<h1>How is cheese made?</h1>
			<p>Cheese is a dairy product made from milk.
			It is produced by coagulating or curdling milk to separate the solid curds from the liquid whey.
			The coagulation can be achieved through the use of rennet or by adding acid, such as lemon juice or vinegar.
			The curds are then typically pressed and aged, leading to the formation of cheese.</p>
			<h1>What does grass fed mean?</h1>
			<p> When animals, such as cows, are grass-fed, it means that a significant portion of their diet consists of grass.
			For cheese production, the quality of milk is influenced by the diet of the animals.
			Grass-fed milk is often considered to have a distinct flavor profile,
			and some people believe that it results in a richer and more nuanced taste in the cheese. 
			Additionally, there may be nutritional differences between grass-fed and grain-fed milk,
			including higher levels of certain nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants in grass-fed milk. </p>
			<h1>What is raw cheese?</h1>
			<p>When a cheese is made with raw milk, it means that the milk used in the cheese-making process has not been pasteurized before the curdling and fermentation stages.
			Pasteurization is a heat-treatment process that kills harmful bacteria and pathogens in milk, 
			reducing the risk of foodborne illnesses. However, raw milk cheeses are made from milk 
			that has not undergone this pasteurization process. 
			</p>
			<h1>What is microbial rennet?</h1>
			<p>Microbial rennet is a coagulating agent used in the cheese-making process that is derived from microorganisms, such as bacteria or fungi. Traditional rennet,
			which is extracted from the stomach lining of young calves, contains enzymes that play a crucial role in coagulating milk 
			and forming curds during cheese production. However, microbial rennet offers an alternative source for these enzymes,
			making it suitable for vegetarian and microbial-based cheese production.</p>
